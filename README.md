# Full Stack App with React and a REST API

This project uses React to create a client for my existing school database REST API (created in a previous project). This full stack JavaScript application allows users to view a list of courses and the detail for a specific course, sign up to create an account or sign in with an existing account, and create, update, or delete courses.
